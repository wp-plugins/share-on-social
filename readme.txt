Drive new users to your site and increase engagement through interactive shares. 
 

== Description ==

Share on Social allows you to lock a part of content of WordPress Post or Page until user shares your blogs in social media. Plugin posts the shared link as interactive posts to users' wall and  helps you to drive new visitors and increase engagement.   


= Key Features =

* Interactive Posts. Share on Social plugin shares the blog as Interactive Posts in Google Plus and Facebook, which displays the link to your blog prominently on users' Wall. 
* Share any link. By default, plugin shares blog URL, but you are free to attach blogs' parent, site or even external URL to share buttons.
* Unlimited lockers. Create unlimited number of lockers and customize each differently. 
* Multiple lockers. Allows you to place multiple lockers on a page or post.
* Group the lockers. This advanced feature allows you to group a set of lockers from a blog or even from multiple blogs. Grouped lockers lock and unlock in unison.
* Customizable locker banner. Visual Editor allows you to style your own banner for the locker.
* Remembers users who already unlocked your content (via cookies).
* Locks any type of content: text, videos, images, links, forms and more.
* SEO friendly. Search bots (Google, Bing, etc) can crawl locked content.
* Statistics. Track shares by date and social media. You can also view total shares since plugin activation.      
* Lite on WordPress. Plugin doesn't create custom tables in Wordpress database. This leaves your installation neat and clean.
* Compatible with all the popular browsers.
